## WORK EXPERIENCE 

### Game Engine Programmer, Netease Game `2021.2 - 2023.8`
_Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China_

- Decreased the **memorizer cost of Baked Global Illumination Data** by using Moving Basis Decomposition Method which achieved **10 times compact rate**. 

- Boosted the **performance of compacted light probe** by merging Machine Learning Method and Spherical Harmonics Rebuild Process without more cost. 

- Decreased the influence of **Light Leak Problem** by designing Machine Learning method. The solution matched  requirements of open world global illumination, which was used in Game: Once Human. 

- Developed a **space navigation solution** by designing tetrahedron space navigation algorithm, which is **5 times** faster than 3D Flight Navigation Using Sparse Voxel Octree. 

- Core Competencies: Problem Solving, Research, Innovation, Communication(Oral).
