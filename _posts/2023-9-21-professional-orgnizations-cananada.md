(2) Another aspect of professional system in Canada is **closed nature of profession**.
* A person, who practices the profession without an explicit license, is considered to be practicing the profession illegally and could face legal action.


The **statutory nature** of professional associations in Canada gives it a strong **social contract** model.

## 5 Evolution of Quebec's Professional System

(1) History

Prior to 1970, the professional system in Québec could be characterized by the existence of weak social contracts.

* the lack of direct accountability
* the acceptance of the “liberal professional”
* the absence of a strong, legally binding code

 Result: weak social accountability of the professional system.

(2) Impetus for Change
A major force for change was the Quiet Revolution.
* This period saw the government intervene in reforming sectors of health, education and social welfare to institute policies that we see around us.


The commission recommended re-organizing the professional system to make it appropriate to the province's new social and economic changes.

(3) Qubec's Revamped Professional System

In 1973, the National Assembly of Quebec initiated the re-organization of a new professional system. The professional system has its legal basis in the Professional Code.
