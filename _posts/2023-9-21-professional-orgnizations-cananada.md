### Lesson 1

***Q: How has the concept of “professional” evolved over the years?***

A:

Professions in the ancient world: Professions in the present sense were absent in the ancient world. A professional was a person who professed his/her faith publicly. 

Professions in medieval Europe were differentiated into members of religious orders or those who were members of secular guilds. 

In mordern world, Professionals are said to be white collar workers. Professionals are usually engaged in administrative or technical work in exchange of which they receive salaries

***Q:  What were guilds? What types of guilds existed in medieval times? What key responsibilities did they hold? What services did they offer their members?***

A: 

Guilds: Exclusive organizations created to preserve rights and privileges of membership. Guild associations received authority from kings, city hall or clergy.

Types：
* Merchant guilds: created to protect traders.
* Craft guilds: group of craftsmen involved in same profession.

Responsibilities:
* Restricted poor workmanship
* Forbade advertising
* Regulated proces
* Exerted monopoly control
* Limited number of master

Services:
* Gave some health insurance to members.
* Supported dependents of members in case of death.
* Made donations to city.
* Served as councilors.
* Constructed public buildings.


***Q: How does the post-industrial economy differ from the earlier manufacturing-based economy?***

A: 

Postindustrial society, as the name implies, is a society where the major source of employment has shifted away from **manufacturing-based mass production in factories** towards a **service-oriented economy**. A service-oriented economy is driven by **employment in sectors that provide an array of services to society**.  These services include things like transportation and logistics, supply chain and retail, trade, finance, insurance, real estate, and professional business services.


With the exit of heavy manufacturing work that people do in a postindustrial economy can be **characterized into three categories**: business entrepreneur, professional employee and service worker.


***Q:  What are the differences between business entrepreneur, white-collar worker, and blue-collar worker?***

A: 

Business entrepreneur: Owns a business enterprise; Generate revenue from a stock of human, financial or physical capital.

White-collar worker: Salaries with high wages; Administrative or technical work; Risk of obsolescene.

Blue-collar worker: members who sell their manual labour; earn hourly wages for their labour, limited or no benefits; Risk of technological obsolescence.


***Q:  Elaborate on the four attributes of modern professionals discussed in the lesson: specialized skill, judgement, self-governance, advancing social welfare.***

A:

Specialized Skill: A key aspect of the nature of skill that professionals possess is that it is composed of varied and intellectually demanding techniques and practices, thus requires individuals to exert considerable effort in acquiring them. I

Judgement: A key factor of this attribute arises from the nature of the work that professionals perform. Since the work is **varied and not routine work**, it cannot be mechanized. The **variation in the requirements of work** means that individuals as part of their work have to make choices. These choices while based on the training they receive, have to be made by the understanding of the individual. These choices have direct consequences for the public.

Self-governance: Given the specialized training and knowledge that professionals possess, and given the importance of their work for public welfare, it is vitally important that the actions of professionals be governed by other professionals who are capable of evaluating the nature of work they do. Thus modern professionals need to be members of self-governing professional associations. These associations are usually established by the government to govern the actions of professionals to ensure that they practice their profession to further public welfare.

Advancing social welfare:  If they practice their profession in an ethical fashion, professionals make a significant contribution to improving the welfare of citizens. Conversely, malpractice or the unethical practice of the profession can have a significantly adverse effect on citizens and society. 


***Q:  Why is it impossible for individuals to become engineers simply by working as apprentices for years?***

A: This is so because many of the techniques require **a base of scientific, technological or mathematical education** that can only be gained from **university based education**. It is therefore not enough to have an individual serve as an apprentice for practical training.

***Q: What benefits arise from having professionals form self-regulating organisations?***

A: 

* These associations are usually established by the government to govern the actions of professionals to ensure that they practice their profession to further public welfare.

***Q:  What main differences exist between the work and responsibilities of an independent professional and an employed professional?***

A: 

Independent professionals as the name indicates **work independently** and are **paid directly by the client** for the service provided by the professional. As a result of their independence in employment these professionals **have much greater autonomy** in their actions.

An employed professional, on the other hand, is usually **hired by a company or organization**. In return for **a monthly salary**, the professional provides their services to their employer. It is the employer that usually sets the terms of their work and so the professional has **much less autonomy** in their actions.

***Q:  What is the purpose of professional licensing?***

A: Breaking formal rules can result in penalties and depending on the nature of violation even loss of license. It is through the licensing system that **the actions of professionals are governed by the government**. 

Government can gover the behaviour of engineers. Ensure that professions are organized to be accountable to society. Professional associations composed of professionals practicing the same profession are a key aspect of the linkage between professionals and society.



***Q: Why can it be said that all professions are “moral enterprises”?***

A:

Although professions are organized around technical practices and actions, the actions of individuals are not just limited to technical principles but involve significant moral content. the choices that professionals have to make in their work are not just about technical aspects, but have moral and ethical dimensions. Any choice a professional makes has impacts on people in society. 

***Q: What is the danger of mixing professional and personal values?***

A：

Mixing professional and personal values is a tricky thing, and should **require judgment on the part of the professional**. Some level of mixing is considered OK, but in other circumstances, mixing personal and professional values would **be considered a “conflict of interest” and should be avoided**. 

### Lesson 2

***Q: What does it mean that professional associations in Canada are “statutory bodies”?***

A： 

In other words, the work of professional associations is strengthened by **the power of a law passed by the respective provincial legislative assembly**. Each professional associations derives its power to **control individual professionals** from this statutory standing.


***Q: Why is the professional system for engineers in Quebec and the other provinces considered “closed”?***

A：

In order to practice most professions in Canada, an individual has to **become a member of the corresponding professional association**.  A person, who practices the profession without an explicit license, is considered to be practicing the profession illegally and could face legal action. 

***Q： How can the professional system in Québec prior to the 1970s be characterized? Which challenges did this present in terms of accountability? ***

A: 

**History of Quebec**

Prior to 1970, the professional system in Québec could be characterized by **the existence of weak social contracts**.

**Challenges that present in terms of accountability**

(1) The professional system **did little to be explicitly accountable to society**. This lack of direct accountability was the product of non-standardized professional associations, whose mandates were not uniform across the province.

(2) Another fact was the acceptance of the **“liberal professional”**. A liberal professional operated with limited oversight and was independent to conduct their professional practice.

(3) A related aspect was **the absence of a strong, legally binding code** that governed the conduct of individual professionals.

A combination of these three factors resulted in the weak social accountability of the professional system.



***Q: How is the professional system for engineers in Canadian provinces different from the system in the United States?***

A:

Engineering Professional Associations:
* Canada: Statutorily self-regulated.
* USA: Not governed by a comprehensive legislation. Managed by a board constitued with both engineers and non-engineers.

Practice of the Profession：
* Canada: Need to obtain a professional license, Illegal to work as an engineer without the professional license.
* USA:Possible to do engineering work without an engineering license.

***Q: In what way does the professional model in Quebec emphasize member responsibilities, rather than rights?***

A: 

It is important to remember that the professional system in Canada follows **the social contract model** and not the collective bargaining model. **The social contract model** places more emphasis on member responsibilities rather than rights. 


***Q: Within the professional system in Quebec, what is the role of***
* Government of Quebec?
* Professional Tribunal?
* Office des Professions du Québec?
* Quebec Interprofessional Council?
* Professional Orders? (25 with reserved titles and exclusive practice / 21 with reserved titles)

A: 

(1) Government of Quebec(Minister of Justice).
* **Reports to the National Assembly of Quebec** on the operation of the professional system. 
* Minister presents legislations and resolutions regarding to the professional system.

(2) Professional Tribunal
* Judges who are appointed by the court of Quebec.
* Hears appeals on decisions made by disciplinary councils of different orders.

(3) Office des Professions du Quebec
* Advises the government of Quebec on **all matters related to the functioning of the professional system**.
* Ensures the different orders respect their mission.

(4) Qubec Interprofessional Council
* Composed of representatives of all 46 orders.
* **Advisory body** that can be consulted on professional matters.

(5) 46 Professional Orders
They ensures **the protection of the public**. Two types of professionals order:
* Professions with reserved titles & exclusive practice(25).(OIQ)
* Professions with reserved titles.

Minister responsible for the administration of legislation respecting the professions.


***Q: What is the role of the OIQ (Ordre des Ingenieurs du Quebec)?***

A: **Engineering practice in Québec is governed by the Ordre de Ingénieurs du Quebec, or the OIQ**. 

* One of the 46 professional orders in Quebec that are recognized by the Government to regulate themselves.

* All engineers in Quebec who engage in professional activities must be members of the OIQ.



***Q: What is the function of each of the following acts/legislation in regulating the engineering profession in Quebec?***
* The Professional Code.
* The Engineers Act (fields of practice, titles etc.).
* The Code of Ethics of Engineers.
* Bill 101.

A：

**The rules pertaining to the professional activities of engineers** are set out in the Professional Code, the Engineers Act, the Code of Ethics of Engineers and other regulations, and the Bill 101, that governs the primacy of the French language in the province.

* The Professional Code: The professional system has **its legal basis** in the Professional Code. The Professional Code is **a law of public order** that was passed by the National Assembly to reflect its desire to protect the public in matters concerning professional service.In other words, the professional code is **a law that lays down in detail how Québec’s professional system should be organized and administered**. The Professional Code describes the key components of the professional system. It also specifies **the actions of different professional orders** that are part of the professional system. Finally, it creates **a single law** that applies to the entire professional system in the province. 

* Engineers Act: **Legal basis of OIQ**. The Engineers Act
specifies **some important aspects of practicing the engineering profession** in Québec. It defines a member as a person on the roll of OIQ; defines an engineer as a member of the OIQ; define the field of practice of an engineer; defines the kinds of acts that count as engineering practice; Reserve professional titles. The field of practice includes the kind of work that requires an engineer and the kinds of acts that counters engineering practice, including consultation, measurement, design, drawing and inspection.


* The Code of Ethics of Engineers: This code **outlines the ethical principles and standards that engineers must follow in their work**, including obligations related to public safety, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, and honesty. **It serves as a guide for ethical behavior and provides a basis for the OIQ to enforce disciplinary actions in cases of ethical violations by its members**.


* Bill 101: While Bill 101 is not specific to the engineering profession, **it may have implications for language requirements and language use in professional engineering practice in Quebec**. It **promotes the use of the French language in various aspects of public life, including professional communication, documentation, and education**. Engineers in Quebec may need to ensure compliance with language requirements when conducting their professional activities.

### Lesson 3

***Q： What is ethics?***

A： Ethics is the systematic analysis of behavioral choices that humans or societies face. The key point is that it is a way of analyzing and thinking about choices. 

Ethics **differs from decision tools**, because it helps humans to **reflect on questions of right or wrong, of obligations and rights, or whether social and political goals are being met**. 

***Q: Why do we need ethics? ***

A: 

A simple answer is that ethics are needed to help humans make choices. Given that we need to make choices in our lives, it helps to have **a mechanism that can guide how we think, reflect and then justify the choice we make**. 

* Ethics provides a means to rationally reason your choices. Ethics provides a reliable and impersonal way of thinking about larger societal choices.

* There is another important reason for relying on ethics to make vital decisions because it allows us to avoid two pitfalls that many of us find ourselves in when making a decision. 

***Q: What are the pitfalls of “absolutism” and “relativism,” and how can a structured and reflective approach to ethics avoid these?***

A: 

**One pitfall is the belief in absolutism** that means the irrespective of circumstances, my decision never changes because my morals are absolute and always true.

**A second pitfall is the belief in relativism** that suggests that one can never make a decision that is ok for everyone because all decisions are subjective and so no one guideline is valid for everyone

***Q: What is the difference between morals and ethics?***

A: 

Ethics: Broadly ethics is an understanding of the philosophical basis for making moral choices. The key point is that the individual arrives at an understanding of what is an ethical action through **a process of philosophically structured thinking and reflection**. This process allows an individual to make choices in an objective fashion.

Moral: Morals, on the other hand, are closely related to personal opinion. Morals are arrived not through a process of reflection, but through **a process of classification of right and wrong acts that are dependent on cultural, religious or customary norms**.

* While ethics are **the systematic analysis of human behavior**, morals are **customary norms of behavior**. 
* While morals **vary with time and geography**, ethical frameworks are **not specific to cultural or geographic contexts**. 
* While ethics are **products of rational examination**, morals are acquired through **socialization or being a member of a particular community**. 
* While morals could be considered as **personal opinion**, ethics are **impersonal in nature**.

***Q: What are internal influences on practice of a professional morality?***

A: 

Internal Influcens: Internal influences are those that an individual uses to change their behavior. Self Governance.
* Ethics
* Values
* Engineering Ethics

***Q:  What are external influences on practice of professional morality?***

A: 

External Influcens: Governance by an outside authority. External influences are societal forces that shape an individual's behavior. 
* Law
* Morals
* Engineering Ethics

***Q:  How do internal and external influences work together to create “engineering ethics”?***

A: 

A good example of how a professional ethics influences an individual's behavior is through **the professional code of ethics**.

OIQ's code of ethics for engineers. Def: National Assembly requires engineers to adpot a code that would establish rules of conduct for professional practice. The code of ethics is a mandatory regulation for engineers. The code specifies that engineers have some required duties and obligations towards **public**, **clients**, including **employers**, **profession of engineering**.

***Q: Why can we say that an engineer’s approach to ethical problems is similar to engineering design thinking?***

A: 

The ethics problesm rarely have a correct answer that will be arrived at by everyone in the class. In engineering design, there is no unique correct answer.

Both engineering ethics and engineering design apply **a large body of knowledge** to the solution of a problem, both involve the **use of analytical skills**.

***Q:  There are four recognized goals engineering ethics. Explain what is meant by each:***

A:

* moral awareness: Awareness of value conflicts that underlie choices.
* moral autonomy: Ability to think critically and independently about moral issues.
* moral imagination: Ability to discern alternative solutions to moral dilemmas.
* moral communication: Ability to communicate ethical issues in a precise and reasonable manner.
