## Lesson 7

### 7.1 Professional Digity

Dignity is a feeling of respect or esteem that an individual holds themselves in. Certain actions can cause damage to the positive sense of esteem about the person. Causing damage to the positive feeling of esteem of a person could cause grievous psychological harm to the individual. 

In a similar fashion, professional dignity is considered a positive sense of esteem that the profession has **collectively acquired as result of the positive contributions the profession makes to society**. But this dignity or honourable reputation of the profession is fragile and can easily be compromised. Any member of the profession, through their irresponsible actions can cause damage to the dignity of the profession. In Québec, it is a mandatory duty of each individual engineer to **safeguard the dignity of the profession**. This duty is prescribed in the province’s Professional Code and in the Code of Ethics for Engineers.


### 7.2 Relations with the Order of Engineers 

Maintaining professional dignity requires the individual professional to demonstrate adequate respect for the Order, and for the role the Order plays in ensuring engineers are accountable to society. As a result, it is very important for the individual engineer to **take his or her relations with the Order very seriously**.

 These relations are scrutinized very strictly by the Order. **One important requirement is for an engineer to comply with any request from the Order to participate in the self-governance of the profession.**
 
  The engineer does not have a choice and must agree to **contribute voluntarily to the Order**. Similarly, the engineer must reply to any correspondence or letter from the Order as soon as possible. Delayed replies could form the basis for a disciplinary investigation. 
  
  Another vital point is that individuals are forbidden to interfere, or otherwise,**obstruct a professional inspection or investigation conducted by the Order**. During such an inspection or investigation, an engineer is required to submit all their professional records (including their computers) for scrutiny. Not complying with such an order can result in a disciplinary investigation.



### 7.3 OIQ Controls Over its Members

**The Order of Engineers Quebec (OIQ)** exercises considerable control over its members to ensure that the association as a whole is meeting its **legislative mandate of developing engineers**, who remain accountable to society and who contribute positively to public welfare. In order to do so, OIQ exerts control on key aspects:
* membership, 
* nature of practice, 
* social accountability. 

We will examine each of these aspects in detail.

#### 7.3.1 Membership

For an engineer, to be **a member of the OIQ** is crucial to practice the profession. This is so because in Quebec **a person can be designated an engineer in the workplace only if they are a registered member of OIQ.** A member of **OIQ is required to hold a permit issued by OIQ** and **their name be entered on OIQ’s roll**. Thus, if for some reason they lose their membership, it is not possible for the person to continue practicing the engineering profession legally. Thus, it becomes vital for a member to constantly meet membership conditions. Important membership conditions are as follows:

* Ensure registration on the roll every year on April 1st.
* Not be temporarily or permanently stricken off the roll of OIQ.
* Ensure that your permit is not revoked by the disciplinary council.
* Meet important membership conditions for member renewal. These conditions include not having a criminal record outside the profession in Canada or in another country. Another condition is to have completely paid any disciplinary penalties or assessment during the year. 

It may also be required to meet **physical/mental competencies** to continue active professional life.

#### 7.3.2 Nature of Practice

##### (1) Emsure Continuous Monitoring of Practice of Engineers

A major function of OIQ is to **ensure continuous monitoring of the practice of engineers registered with it**. OIQ employs different methods to monitor the professional practice.

 A vital and ongoing responsibility is exercised through the process of professional inspection. 
 * **Professional inspection** is conducted at OIQ by the Professional Inspection Committee.
    * **The primary mission of the inspection committee** is to ensure that **their membership meets minimum required standards for proper professional practice.**
    * In order to evaluate **standards of professional practice**, inspectors can **examine any material aspect of practice**, including records, books, registers, chemicals, products, substances, apparatus, and equipment entrusted to the professional by a client or employer.

The Committee **conducts general inspection according to a program published in the PLAN (the professional magazine published by the OIQ)**. In addition to the general inspection, the committee also conducts **specialized inspection of a member**, if it is explicitly asked to do so as part of an investigation. If during the inspection, **the committee believes that the member is engaging in unethical practice, it cannot take disciplinary action but it can inform the Syndic if there are reasonable grounds that an offence has been committed**.

 ##### (2) Discipline and Penalty

 Another major aspect of professional practice that is controlled by OIQ is **discipline and penalty**. All members of OIQ (including retired members or junior engineers) can have their professional practice investigated. **Investigation is an internal process that aims to examine if unethical or offending practice was undertaken by a member**. 
 
 Once the process of investigation concludes that **unethical practice** was indeed conducted, the member is **liable for disciplinary actions or penalties**. 
 
 * In Québec, the OIQ has exclusive jurisdiction over any such investigations or disciplinary processes. In other words, these investigations or disciplinary processes cannot be challenged in a regular civil or criminal court.
 * Investigations of malpractice are investigated by the Syndic. After concluding the investigation, the Syndic makes their recommendation to the OIQ’s disciplinary council. 
 * It is the disciplinary council that judges the complaint, hears the member and makes a decision to award penalties. According to the gravity of the offense committed by the engineer, t**he disciplinary council can recommend the following penalties**:
    * An oral reprimand;
    * removing the member temporarily or permanently from the roll; 
    * a fine of $1,000-$12,500 with fines doubled for repeat offences;
    * an obligation to remit a sum of money to the entitled person; 
    * or restriction or suspension to engage in professional activities.


#### 7.3.3 Social Accountability

A key means of ensuring that members remain accountable to society is **through the conciliation or arbitration process**. The **conciliation or arbitration process** is a means adopted by OIQ to serve society. 

Any resident of Québec, who is unhappy over the fees they provided to an engineer and feels they were over-charged, can **utilize OIQ’s arbitration process to determine if they were actually over-charged**. 
* This procedure applies **only when the member is engaged in private practice and not employed by a company**. 

As part of the arbitration process, the OIQ can examine the quality of service provided by the engineer to verify if the client was overcharged or not. If the investigation reveals that the engineer did over-charge the client for their services, OIQ’s council of arbitration will determine **the amount of reimbursement the engineer has to pay to the client**.

##### About Learning Activity

Building trust as an engineer requires attention to at least six components: 

1) disclosing limits, 

2) integrity and transparency, 

3) availability and diligence, 

4) independence and impartiality, 

5) confidentiality,

6) fees. 

Bear in mind these components as you go through the two scenarios and answer the questions. Take some time to reflect on your answers.





## Lesson 8

### 8.1 Duty towards the Public

This is a key duty for engineers who wish to practice the profession in Québec. Here the term public is understood very broadly. When we use the term public, we usually mean citizens. The meaning of public refers to **the duty of engineers to the citizens** of Québec/Canada. But it also uses public in another sense to mean the opposite of private. In that sense, public means the common good of people in Québec. **Engineers have a duty to safeguard the common public good in Québec**. This duty to safeguard the common public good is enforced through two duties – the first to humanity and the second to protect life and environment.

 

#### 8.1.1 Duty to Humanity

**The Code of Ethics** for engineers specifies that fundamentally “**In all aspects of their work an engineer must respect their obligations towards humanity.**” This duty specifies that, first and foremost, engineers exist to protect and respect humans. While this obligation towards humans arises from many civil and criminal laws, fundamentally it is governed by key legal frameworks in Canadian and Québec law – the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Québec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. The Canadian charter guarantees certain fundamental freedoms to humans living in the country. These freedoms include fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of conscience, religion, belief, expression, and association. In addition, the charter gives rights, such as democratic rights, mobility right, legal rights, equality rights, and language rights. In other words, in their work, professionals have a duty to not violate the provisions of the Canadian charter and the Québec charter. **One major implication of this duty** is to ensure that engineers do not engage in discrimination of any form. **Discrimination** is a violation of the Canadian charter, especially the equality rights specified in it. In turn, this means that no professional may refuse to provide services to a person because of their race, colour, age, sex, religion, national origin or ethnicity of such person.

 

#### 8.1.2 Duties towards Life and Environment         

**The Code of Ethics** also specifies that “In all aspects of their work, the engineer must take into account the consequences of the performance of his work on the environment and on the life, health and property of every person.” There are two aspects to this duty. The first is to **act in a manner to safeguard the environment**, and the second is to **be mindful of the life, health, and property of every human**. Safeguarding the environment requires the engineer to be mindful of technological choices that do not promote the pollution and eventual destruction of the environment and will further sustainable development. The respect for life, health and property relates closely to the rights mentioned in the Canadian charter.

### 8.2 Ethics Construcst

#### 8.2.1 Prejudice

An opinion formed without taking time and care to judge fairly, often based on **incomplete and stereotyped information**.

#### 8.2.2 Discrimination

Treating people differently because of **some particular social attribute** such as race, gender, or religion.

Adverse Effect Discrimination: Discrimination that happens as a result of **applying a rule or policy uniformly**.

</figure>

**Systemactic Discrimination**: A discrimination that is rooted in accepted ways of doing this in a business profession or occupation. This tends to prevent categories of people from achieving their goals.
* Glass Ceiling: A form of systemic discrimination that prevents women from achieving their full potential by **blocking advances in their careers beyond a point**.
* Cultural Imperialism: A form of systemic discrimination that reduces some cultures as **secondary to other more successful or widespread cultures**.
* Physical/Attritudinal Barriers: prevent differently abled from achieving their full potential not because of targeted discrimination but because fullyt abled cannot perceive the barriers that the differently abled face.

**Direct Discrimination**: Discrimination that is directed against person on the basis of prejudice.


#### 8.2.2 Harassment

This is a particular type of discrimination. It occurs when a person is subjected to unwanted behaviour that offends, demeans or humilitates. Form:
* Sexual
* Racial
* Ridicule

### 8.3 Thinking About Inclusivity and Diversity

#### 8.3.1 Prejudice, Discrimination, and Harassment

In thinking about discrimination, it is useful to understand the concept in the context of two related concepts of **prejudice and harassment**. 
* The Association of Professional Engineers, Geophysicists, and Geologists of Alberta (APEGGA) defines **prejudice** as **an opinion formed without taking time and care to judge fairly, often based on incomplete and stereotyped information**. The key point is that prejudice is a biased **opinion that is often based on incomplete information**. 
* Discrimination is usually built on prejudiced opinions, but **it takes prejudice a step further because it influences behaviours**. Discrimination implies treating people differently because of **some particular social attribute, such as race, gender or religion. Discrimination**, when it results in an extreme form of behavior, results in harassment. It occurs when an individual is subjected to **unwanted behaviour that offends, demeans, or humiliates**.

Discrimination comes in several forms, some of them are directed while others are less easy to identify. 
* **Direct discrimination** is discrimination that is directed against person(s) on the basis of prejudice. This is the most clearly identifiable form of discrimination, primarily because it happens in the open so that people become aware of it. 
* Another form of discrimination is **adverse effect discrimination**. It is a discrimination that happens as a result of applying a rule or policy uniformly. When governments or companies apply a policy in society, it often discriminates against groups in society as a result. 

A good example is positive discrimination in **hiring that favours visible minorities or women**. There is an adverse effect discrimination that is created against those who do not fall within these groups. Their chances at getting the same jobs have been reduced because of the preference that underrepresented groups have. 

* A final form of discrimination is **systemic discrimination**. This discrimination is widespread but not very easy to identify. It is a discrimination that is rooted in accepted ways of doing things in a business, profession, or occupation. This tends to prevent categories of people from achieving their goals. 

A good example of this is the glass ceiling. The glass ceiling is the existence of a barrier that prevent women from advancing in their careers in that organization beyond a particular level.

#### 8.3.2 Multiculturalism and Diversity

**Multiculturalism and diversity** are the **opposite of discrimination**. 
* Diversity is **the variety in different social categories**, such as gender, race, ethnicity, age, religion, national origin or sexual orientation. 
* Multiculturalism is **an equal acceptance for social differences in terms of gender, age, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race or national origin**. 

While diversity is **the presence of cultural differences in society**, multiculturalism is a **positive accepting attitude towards these differences**. Such a multicultural orientation that fosters diversity has several advantages. It fosters a spirit of **mutual understanding in the workplace**, and more importantly, it allows everyone to develop their abilities to its full potential. 

In Canada, **multiculturalism** is **an official policy** that reflects **an equal acceptance of races, religions, languages and cultures**. This policy is furthered through Canadian **legislation**. The **preservation and enhancement of multicultural heritage in Canada** is the **aim of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms**. In addition, Canada’s Multiculturalism Act of 1988 protects aboriginal rights, and the rights of people to enjoy their cultures and use of languages other than English and French. This legal background has allowed a mix of ethnic groups, languages, and cultures to co-exist in Canada. It is for these reasons that Canada is considered **a cultural mosaic** unlike U.S., which has adopted **a melting pot approach**. Canada, unlike U.S., seeks to foster diversity without **assimilating different cultural groups**.   


### 8.4 Honesty

Honesty is a **moral virtue** that is widely accepted but not very well understood, primarily because it is **a practice relevant to many different facets of our existence in society**. 
In such a situation, since we could encounter honesty in so many spheres of our life, we do not often realize that we have been **honest or dishonest in a particular aspect**. In the personal sphere, honesty can be interpreted as **truth-telling**. 

So **an honest person is one who can be relied on to tell the truth irrespective of circumstances**. 

But in the professional context, **honesty is not limited to just speaking the truth**. 

It also implies **representing oneself, our actions, and our views openly and truthfully**. So in addition to honesty **being the act of truth telling**, it also means that to be honest in the workplace implies:
* the act of following scientific facts, 
* the act of avoiding inappropriate means, 
* the act of showing respect to colleagues in a professional relationship. 

The difference between **honesty** as **truth-telling** and **honesty** as **correct representation of actions** can be distinguished by the difference between **an act of commission** and **an act of omission**. While telling a deliberate lie would be an act of commission on the part of the person speaking a lie; on the other hand, we lie by omission when we neglect to mention a relevant event, information, or circumstance to a person. Thus, **honest representation requires us to avoid both acts of commission and omission**.      


#### 8.4.1 Duty to be Honest

Although not mentioned separately as a mandatory duty for engineers, the duty to **be honest has considerable overlap with the trust-building obligations of engineers** towards clients or employers and with **their duty towards humanity**. But a few obligations indicate the duty to be honest. These are:

* The engineer shall express their opinion on matters dealing with engineering, only if such opinion is based on sufficient knowledge and honest convictions.
* An engineer must be impartial in their relations between the client and the contractors, suppliers, etc.
* An engineer must safeguard their independence at all times to avoid situations of conflict of interest. 


#### 8.4.2 Whistleblowing     

 Whistleblowing is an act that **follows directly from the requirement of engineers to be honest and transparent in their actions and views**. It has been defined as **an act by an employee of informing the public or higher management of unethical or illegal behavior by an employer or supervisor**. As an engineer, if you come to know of **the commission of unethical or illegal actions in the workplace**, your duty to be honest as an engineer demands that you approach either the supervisor or the public to **reveal the existence of such actions**. Not doing so would mean you have **engaged in an act of omission**. 
 
 Whistleblowing can be categorized into two types – internal or external, depending upon whether the **whistle is blown inside or outside** the organization. 
 * Internal whistleblowing would mean going over the head of an immediate supervisor (who maybe engaged in unethical action) to a higher level of management. 
 * External whistleblowing would mean going outside the company and report unethical or illegal actions to the media or to law-enforcement agencies directly.

In the context of professional engineering in Québec, there are well instituted procedures for whistleblowing. At a first level, when you encounter an illegal or unethical action in your workplace, **your action should be to bring it to the attention of the company**, first verbally, and then failing which clearly indicate in writing to the company, the consequences that may result from ignoring your advice. If after this, there is no satisfactory resolution, as an engineer, your option, especially when certain works are a danger to public safety, must be to notify the Order. For an engineer in Québec, going public would imply approaching the OIQ rather than going to the media.


## 9. Law and Legal Systems

### 9.1 Law and Legal Systems

#### 9.1.1 Law

Law, as we have described earlier, is **a rule that regulates what is accepted or forbidden in a society**. Laws are created by a **competent authority**, such as a **parliament** or a **legislative assembly**. 

Laws are enforced through a system composed of **enforcement agencies** (example: the police) and the **judiciary**. The body of law that governs a society can be subdivided, according to its focus, into two broad domains – **public law and private law**. 
* Public laws are those laws that govern the actions of the state (or government) or the relations of the state and individuals. Examples of public law are international law, constitutional law, administrative law, or criminal law. 
* Private law, on the other hand, is solely concerned with regulating the relations and disputes between private individuals. Examples of private law include commercial law, family law, property law, etc.       

#### 9.1.2 Legal Systems

Legal systems are related to laws, but as the name implies, it is the system that has built up around the process of **implementing laws in a society**. Legal systems could be defined as existing system for interpreting and enforcing laws. A legal system becomes the basis for:

* The sources of laws and regulations that govern a society
* The practices and customs followed by courts in interpreting laws to make decisions regarding legal disputes
* And as frameworks that govern interpretation of statutes, legislation and bylaws

Different countries around the world have different legal systems. In this module, you will find a map of the world indicating the major legal systems and their combinations, which are prevalent in different countries. Click on the major legal systems to understand their key features. In this class, we are concerned with two major legal systems – civil law and English common law systems. There are some key features that distinguish these two major legal systems. First, in a civil law system, laws are written into systematic collections referred to as codes. Second, Laws are created by legislatures alone. Third, legal decisions made by judges are based solely on applying the laws to the case. Finally, justice is produced through an inquisitorial process led by the judge. English common law, on the other hand, is based on laws and earlier cases that are similar. Second, laws are created both by legislatures and judges on the basis of the precedence value of earlier cases and judgments. Third, legal decisions are based not only on laws but also on precedence value of previous judgments. Finally, justice is produced through an adversarial process between two opposing sets of advocates with the judge acting as a neutral umpire.
