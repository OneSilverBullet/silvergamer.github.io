## Lesson 7

### 7.1 Professional Digity

Dignity is a feeling of respect or esteem that an individual holds themselves in. Certain actions can cause damage to the positive sense of esteem about the person. Causing damage to the positive feeling of esteem of a person could cause grievous psychological harm to the individual. 

In a similar fashion, professional dignity is considered a positive sense of esteem that the profession has **collectively acquired as result of the positive contributions the profession makes to society**. But this dignity or honourable reputation of the profession is fragile and can easily be compromised. Any member of the profession, through their irresponsible actions can cause damage to the dignity of the profession. In Québec, it is a mandatory duty of each individual engineer to **safeguard the dignity of the profession**. This duty is prescribed in the province’s Professional Code and in the Code of Ethics for Engineers.


### 7.2 Relations with the Order of Engineers 

Maintaining professional dignity requires the individual professional to demonstrate adequate respect for the Order, and for the role the Order plays in ensuring engineers are accountable to society. As a result, it is very important for the individual engineer to **take his or her relations with the Order very seriously**.

 These relations are scrutinized very strictly by the Order. **One important requirement is for an engineer to comply with any request from the Order to participate in the self-governance of the profession.**
 
  The engineer does not have a choice and must agree to **contribute voluntarily to the Order**. Similarly, the engineer must reply to any correspondence or letter from the Order as soon as possible. Delayed replies could form the basis for a disciplinary investigation. 
  
  Another vital point is that individuals are forbidden to interfere, or otherwise,**obstruct a professional inspection or investigation conducted by the Order**. During such an inspection or investigation, an engineer is required to submit all their professional records (including their computers) for scrutiny. Not complying with such an order can result in a disciplinary investigation.



### 7.3 OIQ Controls Over its Members

**The Order of Engineers Quebec (OIQ)** exercises considerable control over its members to ensure that the association as a whole is meeting its **legislative mandate of developing engineers**, who remain accountable to society and who contribute positively to public welfare. In order to do so, OIQ exerts control on key aspects:
* membership, 
* nature of practice, 
* social accountability. 

We will examine each of these aspects in detail.

#### 7.3.1 Membership

For an engineer, to be **a member of the OIQ** is crucial to practice the profession. This is so because in Quebec **a person can be designated an engineer in the workplace only if they are a registered member of OIQ.** A member of **OIQ is required to hold a permit issued by OIQ** and **their name be entered on OIQ’s roll**. Thus, if for some reason they lose their membership, it is not possible for the person to continue practicing the engineering profession legally. Thus, it becomes vital for a member to constantly meet membership conditions. Important membership conditions are as follows:

* Ensure registration on the roll every year on April 1st.
* Not be temporarily or permanently stricken off the roll of OIQ.
* Ensure that your permit is not revoked by the disciplinary council.
* Meet important membership conditions for member renewal. These conditions include not having a criminal record outside the profession in Canada or in another country. Another condition is to have completely paid any disciplinary penalties or assessment during the year. 

It may also be required to meet **physical/mental competencies** to continue active professional life.

#### 7.3.2 Nature of Practice

##### (1) Emsure Continuous Monitoring of Practice of Engineers

A major function of OIQ is to **ensure continuous monitoring of the practice of engineers registered with it**. OIQ employs different methods to monitor the professional practice.

 A vital and ongoing responsibility is exercised through the process of professional inspection. 
 * **Professional inspection** is conducted at OIQ by the Professional Inspection Committee.
    * **The primary mission of the inspection committee** is to ensure that **their membership meets minimum required standards for proper professional practice.**
    * In order to evaluate **standards of professional practice**, inspectors can **examine any material aspect of practice**, including records, books, registers, chemicals, products, substances, apparatus, and equipment entrusted to the professional by a client or employer.

The Committee **conducts general inspection according to a program published in the PLAN (the professional magazine published by the OIQ)**. In addition to the general inspection, the committee also conducts **specialized inspection of a member**, if it is explicitly asked to do so as part of an investigation. If during the inspection, **the committee believes that the member is engaging in unethical practice, it cannot take disciplinary action but it can inform the Syndic if there are reasonable grounds that an offence has been committed**.

 ##### (2) Discipline and Penalty

 Another major aspect of professional practice that is controlled by OIQ is **discipline and penalty**. All members of OIQ (including retired members or junior engineers) can have their professional practice investigated. **Investigation is an internal process that aims to examine if unethical or offending practice was undertaken by a member**. 
 
 Once the process of investigation concludes that **unethical practice** was indeed conducted, the member is **liable for disciplinary actions or penalties**. 
 
 * In Québec, the OIQ has exclusive jurisdiction over any such investigations or disciplinary processes. In other words, these investigations or disciplinary processes cannot be challenged in a regular civil or criminal court.
 * Investigations of malpractice are investigated by the Syndic. After concluding the investigation, the Syndic makes their recommendation to the OIQ’s disciplinary council. 
 * It is the disciplinary council that judges the complaint, hears the member and makes a decision to award penalties. According to the gravity of the offense committed by the engineer, t**he disciplinary council can recommend the following penalties**:
    * An oral reprimand;
    * removing the member temporarily or permanently from the roll; 
    * a fine of $1,000-$12,500 with fines doubled for repeat offences;
    * an obligation to remit a sum of money to the entitled person; 
    * or restriction or suspension to engage in professional activities.


#### 7.3.3 Social Accountability

A key means of ensuring that members remain accountable to society is **through the conciliation or arbitration process**. The **conciliation or arbitration process** is a means adopted by OIQ to serve society. 

Any resident of Québec, who is unhappy over the fees they provided to an engineer and feels they were over-charged, can **utilize OIQ’s arbitration process to determine if they were actually over-charged**. 
* This procedure applies **only when the member is engaged in private practice and not employed by a company**. 

As part of the arbitration process, the OIQ can examine the quality of service provided by the engineer to verify if the client was overcharged or not. If the investigation reveals that the engineer did over-charge the client for their services, OIQ’s council of arbitration will determine **the amount of reimbursement the engineer has to pay to the client**.

##### About Learning Activity

Building trust as an engineer requires attention to at least six components: 

1) disclosing limits, 

2) integrity and transparency, 

3) availability and diligence, 

4) independence and impartiality, 

5) confidentiality,

6) fees. 

Bear in mind these components as you go through the two scenarios and answer the questions. Take some time to reflect on your answers.
