## 1.Overview

### 1.1 Conceptions

Network Architecture: a set of protocols that specify how every layer is to function.

Protocol: a set of rules that governs how two or more communicating parties are to interact.

* HTTP: enable the retrieval of web pages.
* TCP protocol: provides a reliable byte-stream transfer service that can be used to transmit files across the Internet.


Port: an address that identifies which process is to receive a message that is delivered to a given machine.

Well-known Port Number: the service-side port number.

Ephemeral Port Number: the client-side port number.

Domain Name System(DNS) query: determine the IP address corresponding to the host name.

Globally Unique Addresses: 

Datagrams: IP packets.

IP Address: identify the host's network interface. It contains two parts:
* network id.
* host id.

Globally Unique IP Address: each host is identified by it.

Router: a node that is attached to two or more physical networks.

### 1.2 HTTP & Web Browsing Example

HyperText Transfer Protocal(HTTP): specifies rules by which the client and server interact to retrieve a document.

### 1.3 DNS Query

### 1.4 SMTP & E-mail

Simple Mail Transfer Protocal(SMTP):


### 1.5 TCP and UDP Transport Layer Services

Both the TCP and UDP protocols operate by using **the connectionless packet network service** porivided by IP.

* UDP: provides connectionless transfer of **datagrams** between processes in hosts attached to the Internet. 
	* no guarantees no guarantees in terms of delivery or sequence addressing.
	* simple and fast
* TCP: provides for reliable transfer of **a byte stream** between processes in hosts attached to the Internet.
	* error detection
	* retransmission 
	* flow control algorithm


## 2.the OSI Reference Model

The OSI Reference Model:
* Patitioned the communication process into seven layers.
* Provide a framework for talking about the overall communications process.

(1) Physical Layer: deals with the transfer of bits over a communication channel.
* concern with the procedures to set up and release the physical connection.

(2) Data Link Layer: provides for the transfer of frames(blocks of information) across a transmission link that directly connects two nodes. Insert framing information.

(3)Network Layer: provides for the transfer of data in the form of packets across a communication network.

(4) Transport Layer: is responsible for the end-to-end transfer of messages from a process in the source machine to  a process in the destination machine.
* accepts messages from higher layers
* prepare segments or datagrams

(5) Session Layer: control the manner in which data are exchanged.

(6) Presentation Layer: provide the application layer with independence from differences in the representation of data.

(7) Application Layer: provide services that are frequently required by applications that involve communications.

Each Layer adds a header, and also a trailer.

## 3. Unified View of Layers, Protocols, Services


### 3.1 SDU & PDU 

In each layer, a process on one machine carries out a conversation with a peer process on the other machine across a **peer interface**.

Layer n entities: the processes at layer n.

Layer n entities proporties:
* Layer n entities communicate by exchanging protocol data unit(PDU).
Communication between the entities is usually virtual in the scense that no direct communication links exists between them.

    <figcaption>Peer to Peer Connection.</figcaption>
</figure>


For communication to take place, **the layer n+1 entities make use of the service provided by layer n.**

Q: How to transmit the layer n+1 PDU?

A: pass a block of information from layer n+1 through **the layer n access point(SAP)** across a service interface.
* SAP is a software port.
* Each SAP is identified by a unique identifier.

Q: What is the block of information?

A: The block of information passed between layer n and layer n+1 entities consists of **control information** and **a layer n service data unit(SDU)**.
* The layer n SDU is the layer n+1 PDU, and the layer n SDU is **encapsulated** in the layer n PDU.
* The layer n entity uses the control information to form a header that is attached to the SDU to produce **the layer n PDU**.
* The communication process is completed when the SDU(layer n+1 PDU) is passed to the layer n+1 peer process.

**SDU are exchanged between layers, while PDU are exchanged within a layer.**

Layer n+1 as a user of the service provided by layer n, is only interested in the correct execution of the service required to transfer its PDUs. The implement details below layer n+1 are irrelevant.

The service provided by the layer involves accepting a block of information from layer n+1, transfering the information to its peer process, which in turn delivers the block to the user at layer n+1.

### 3.2 Service Type

The service provided by the layer can be **connection oriented** or **connectionless**.

Connection-Oriented Service Phases:

(1) Establishing  a connection between two layer n SAPs.
* intializing state information: the sequence number, flow control variables, buffer allocation.

(2) Transferring layer n-SDU using the layer n protocol.

(3) Tearing down the connection and releasing the resources.
Example: the HTTP and the TCP.

Connectionless serviceï¼š

(1) Each SDU transmitted directly through the SAP.

(2) The control information that is passed from layer n+1 to layer n must contain all the address information required to transfer the SDU.
Example: the DNS and the UDP.

The service provided by the layer n can be confirmed or unconfirmed depending on **whether the sender must enventually be informed of the outcome**.
* The connection setup is usually a confirmed service.
* The connectionless service can  be confirmed or unconfirmed depending on **whether the sending entity needs to receive an acknowledgement**.





### 3.3 Segmentation & Reassembly

If the layer n SDU is too large:

Segmentation: **The layer n SDU is segmented into multi layer n PDUs** that are then transmitted using the service of layer n-1.

Reassembly: **The layer n entity must reassemble the original layer n SDU from the sequence of layer n PDUs** it receives.


If the layer n SDU is too small:

Blocking: the layer n entity block several layer n SDUs int oa single layer n PDU.

Unblocking: the other layer n entity must unblock the received PDU into the individual layer n SDUs.

### 3.4 Multiplexing

**One service** to **Multi users**:

Multiplexing involvs **the sharing of a layer n service** by multiple layer n+1 users.

Demultiplexing: when the layer n PDUs arrive at the other connection end, the layer n SDU is recovered and must then be delivered to the appropriated layer n+1 user.
* a  multiplexing tage is needed in each PDU.

Example: Several application layers share the datagrams service provided by UDP.

Usage: Increase efficiency.

**Multi services** to **One user**:

Splitting: the use of several layer n services to support a single layer n+1 user. The SDUs from the single user are **redirected to one of several layer n entities**, which in turn transfer the given SDU to a peer entity at the destination end.

Recombination: take place at the destination where the SDUs recovered from each of the layer n entities are passed to the layer n+1 user.

Usage: Increase reliability.

## 4. TCP/IP Architecture

## 4.1 TCP/IP Conceptions

**TCP/IP Network Architecture**: a set of protocols that allows communication across multiple diverse networks. 

The TCP/IP model does not require strict layering, and it contains four layers:
(1) Application Layer: provide services that can be used by other applications.
* incorporate the function of the top three layer of OSI Layers.
* application layer programs are intended to run directly over the transport layer.

(2) Transport Layer:
* have two types of services:
	* Transmission Control Protocol(TCP): consists of reliable connection-oriented transfer of a byte stream.
	* User Datagram Protocol(UDP): best-effort connectionless transfer of individual message.

(3) Internet Layer: handles the transfer of information across multiple networks through the use of routers; **deal with the routing of packets**.

* The connect provide single service: best-effort connectionless packet transfer.
* IP packets are exchanged between routers without a connection setup.

(4) the network interface layer: is connected with the network-specific aspects of the transfer of packets.
* the network interface layer is particularly concerned with the protocols that access the intermediate networks.

## 4.2 TCP/IP Protocol: The process of layers working together

On a LAN the attachment of a device to the network is often identified by a phisical address.

Each **Ethernet network interface card(NIC)** is issued a **globally unique medium access control(MAC)** or physical address.
* the machines connected to the NIC have unique address.


Sender information transfer between layers:
(1) The TCP segment is passed to the IP Layer, which in turn encapsulates the segment into Internet Packet.
* IP packet header:
	* protocol field: designate the layer that is operating above IP.
	* IP Address of sender.
	* IP Address of destination.

(2) The IP datagram is then encapsulated using PPP and then sent to the server.

Receiver information transfer between layers:
(1) The server NIC captures the Ethernet frame and extracts the IP datagram and passes it to IP entity. 

(2) The protocal field in IP header indicates that a TCP segment is to be extracted and passed on to the TCP layer.

(3) The TCP layer uses the port number to find out that the message is likely to be passed to the HTTP server process.

End-to-end process-to-process connection: let the receiver know which connection the message correspond to.
* socket address: the port number, the IP address, the protocol type.
* the source socket address and the destination socket address together uniquely specify the connection between the server process and client process.

## 4.3 TCP/IP Protocol: Sending and Receiving IP Datagrams

**Statement1: the client know the server IP address**

(1) The IP entity of client looks at its routing table to see whether it has an entry for the compelete IP address.
* find the server is connected to the same Ethernet.
* find the physical address of the server

(2) The IP datagram is passed to the Ethernet Device Driver, and prepare the Ethernet Frame.
* source physical address w.
* destination physical address s.
* protocol control field

(3) The Ethernet frame is broadcast over the LAN.

(4) The server's NIC recognizes that the frame is intended for its host, so the card captures the frame and examines it.


**Statement2: the client does not know the server IP address**
(1) Check the IP:
* The IP entity of client looks at its routing table to see whether it has an entry for the complete IP address of the PC.
* The IP entity then checks to see whether it has a routing table entry that matches the network id portion of the IP portion of the IP address of the PC.
* The IP entity then checks to see whether it has an entry that specifies a default router.

(2) The IP datagram is passed to the Ethernet device driver, and prepares an Ethernet Frame, and broadcast the LAN.
* source physical address
* destination physical address

(3) The router's NIC captures the Ethernet frame and examines it.

(4) The router finds out the routing table, ecapsulates the examined IP datagram into Ethernet frame and sends it directly to the target.
